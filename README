/htapps/babel/common is a shared web space intended only for shared or
global static content.  It is configured as the default Apache
DocumentRoot.

Because it is shared its role should be limited.  As of this writing
it holds only robots.txt.  It can also serve as a web space to serve
temporary HTML that needs to be seen by the outside world.

Please note the following.

1) You should create subdirectories of web to partition your static
web content based on some scheme to organize the contents. There is
already one scheme for the mdp-related shared content for the
HathiTrust apps (pt, ptsearch, ls, mb, wayf, feedback):

/htapps/babel/common/web/mdp

Other apps may use the files under mdp or create their own
subdirectories of /htapps/babel/common/web

2) /htapps/babel/common, by its nature, creates a coupling between
applications.  When common is deployed, *everything* under your
/htapps/babel/common that has been pushed to the central git repositoy
gets deployed along with *everyone else's* pushed changes.

Because of this, if you have a *lot* of shared static content it
should be put into its own git repository and shared as a submodule of
in the given apps:

/htapps/babel/myapp-one/web/shared-web-stuff/*.{js,css,html,...}
and
/htapps/babel/myapp-two/web/shared-web-stuff/*.{js,css,html,...}
