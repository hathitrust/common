/htapps/common is a shared web space configured as the default Apache
DocumentRoot. Beacuse it is shared, you should create subdirectories
of web to partition your static web content based on some scheme.

There is already one scheme for the mdp-related shared content for the
HathiTrust apps (pt, ptsearch, ls, mb, wayf, feedback):

/htapps/common/web/mdp

Other apps may use the files under mdp or create their own
subdirectories of /htapps/common/web/
