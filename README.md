## mdp

One of the legacy uses of `common` is to store logos for **featured collections**: these are the files in `web/mdp` and reflect various apporaches to organizing --- sometimes by organization (`b/bodleain/bodleian-libraries.png`), sometimes by collection id (`mb/622177961/gl-7-library.png`).
