These `unicorn` styles are no longer actively used and remain to support legacy uses by other applications (e.g. `usdocs_registry`).

SCSS source files (`sass`) are compiled by **compass** to `css`.

The `unicorn` grid is based on an old version of [Susy](https://susy.readthedocs.io/).

An attempt at a style guide is in `docs`, based on an old version of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and can be viewed at https://babel.hathitrust.org/common/unicorn/docs/_site/index.html
