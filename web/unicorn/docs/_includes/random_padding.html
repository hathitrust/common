<p>'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'  thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she  got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster  Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came  very queer indeed:&mdash;</p>

<p>''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'           [later editions continued as follows    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p>

<p>'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the  Gryphon.</p>

<p>'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds  uncommon nonsense.'</p>

<p>Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,  wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.</p>

<p>'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p>

<p>'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next  verse.'</p>

<p>'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them  out with his nose, you know?'</p>

<p>'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully  puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.</p>

<p>'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it  begins "I passed by his garden."'</p>

<p>'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at  the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling  about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was  something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you  thinking of?'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth  bend, I think?'</p>

<p>'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>

<p>'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking  anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p>

<p>'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking  away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p>

<p>'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,  you know!'</p>

<p>The Mouse only growled in reply.</p>

<p>'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the  others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook  its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.</p>

<p>'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite  out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her  daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose  YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little  snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'</p>
