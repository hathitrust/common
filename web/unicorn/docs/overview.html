            The Unicorn Design is a set of stylesheets, fonts, and Javascript to 
            define the common elements across HathiTrust properties.
            These are maintained in the Git repo <tt>/htapps/repos/common.git</tt>, 
            under the path <tt>common/web/unicorn</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deployed, these elements can be linked with URLs like:
            <tt>//babel.hathitrust.org/common/unicorn/css/common.css</tt> 
            (protocol-less to simplify http vs. https handling).
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Does anyone think linking to the common stylesheet from 
                <tt>babel.hathitrust.org</tt> introduce any issues?

                    The stylesheets are being managed with the a combination of 
                    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>,

                    and <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net">Susy</a>. Sass sets up 
                    a number of conveniences that make it easier to develop/extend
                    complex designs and then generating compact, production-ready 
                    CSS.

                    In environments were its simpler to modify CSS, developers
                    can link to the generated CSS and simply add/extend classes
                    as necessary.

                    Small graphic files have been replaced with using glyphs from a custom icon font. Icon fonts have a number of advantages over graphic files chiefly in how they can be
                    styled and respond to the user scaling the browser text.

                    A small number of common Javascript widgets are provided by the Unicorn Design. Most have been borrowed from Bootstrap, with HathiTrust styling.

        <h2>Vendors</h2>
        <p>
            External resources are being maintained in <tt>common/web/unicorn/vendor</tt> to 
            keep them isolated from any local development.
            These are <em>not</em> submodules; most of the external resources are actually 
            generated byproducts, not source.
